ðŸ”¥ Ultimate Last Modified Solution for WordPress. Adds last modified date and time automatically on pages and posts very easily. It is possible to use shortcodes to display last modified info anywhere on a WordPress site running 4.7 and beyond.

== Description ==

### WP Last Modified Info: the Ultimate Last Modified plugin

Most WordPress themes usually show the date when a post was last published. This is fine for most blogs and static websites. However, WordPress is also used by websites where old articles are regularly updated. This last updated date and time is important information for those publications. The most common example is news websites. They often update old stories to show new developments, add corrections, or media files. If they only added the published date, then their users would miss those updates.

Many popular blogs and websites don't show any date on their articles. This is a bad practice and you should never remove dates from your blog posts.

So now it is possible to add last modified/updated info on your WordPress posts and pages. Just install and activate this and configuration is very easy.
