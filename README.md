## Description ##

### WP Last Modified Info: the Ultimate Last Modified plugin for WordPress ###

Most WordPress themes usually show the date when a post was last published. This is fine for most blogs and static websites. However, WordPress is also used by websites where old articles are regularly updated. This last updated date and time is important information for those publications. The most common example is news websites. They often update old stories to show new developments, add corrections, or media files. If they only added the published date, then their users would miss those updates.

Many popular blogs and websites don't show any date on their articles. This is a bad practice and you should never remove dates from your blog posts.

So now it is possible to add last modified / updated info on your wordpress posts and pages. Just install and activate this and configuaration is very easy.

		the_last_modified_info();

#### Published date is equal to modified date. What is the solution? ####

Sometimes you may want to show last modified date only. For that reason, post published date and modified date would be same and the last modified date will still appear on post/pages even if itâ€™s the same as the publish date. In that case, you can set a time difference(ex. 1 day i.e. 24 hours) between post published date and modified date via custom filters.

Use `wplmi_date_time_diff_post` for posts and `wplmi_date_time_diff_page` for pages.

Example

`function override_time_diff() {
       return '86400'; // 86400 seconds i.e. 24 hours, set it according to your need
}`

`add_filter( 'wplmi_date_time_diff_post', 'override_time_diff' ); // for posts`

`add_filter( 'wplmi_date_time_diff_page', 'override_time_diff' ); // for pages`

#### The plugin isn't working or have a bug? ####
